The door remained open; the appearance of Athos, whose wound was known to all, despite the desire to keep it a secret, made a strong impression. The captain's last words were received with a cry of pleasure, and two or three heads, carried away by delight, appeared from behind the drapery.
No doubt de Treville would stop it with harsh words
violation of the rules of etiquette, but he suddenly felt that the hand of Athos was convulsively clenched in
his hand and noticed that he was losing consciousness. At that very moment Athos, having gathered all his
strength to overcome the pain, finally defeated by her, fell as if dead on the parquet.
- Surgeon! shouted de Treville - my, royal, best surgeon - or my brave
ry Athos will die.
At the cry of de Treville, everyone rushed to his office and began to fuss about the wounded man. But
all their efforts would have been useless if the doctor had not happened in the house itself; he passed
through the crowd, approached the insensible Athos and, as the noise and movement prevented him,
then he asked, first of all, that the musketeer be immediately transferred to the next room. De-
Treville opened the door and showed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who carried their comrade away in their arms.
This group was followed by a surgeon; the door closed behind him.
Then de Treville's study, a place usually highly respected, became like
front. Everyone reasoned aloud, spoke loudly, cursed, sent the cardinal to hell
and his guards.
A minute later Porthos and Aramis returned; only the surgeon and de Treville remained beside
wounded.
